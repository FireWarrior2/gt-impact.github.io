<h5 id="general">General</h5>

<p>Parallelism (General) is the ability to perform the same actions simultaneously.</p>

<p>Parallelism (IT) is a property of systems in which multiple computations are performed simultaneously.</p>

<p>If we consider parallelism in the game, it is the execution of one type of recipe several times in one cycle (the energy consumption is proportional to the number of executed recipes).</p>

<p>In the game there is such a concept as Parallel Point (PP). PP is the current parallelism, for example, 4 PP is 4 identical recipes executed in one time (recipe time).</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>

<p>Parallel Point = 4.</p>

<p>Initial recipe: <strong>x</strong> steel ingots in <strong>x</strong> steel plates in <strong>t</strong> time and in <strong>e</strong> EU/t.</p>

<p>Recipe with PP: <strong>4 * x</strong> steel ingots in <strong>4 * x</strong> steel plates in <strong>t</strong> time and in <strong>4 * e</strong> EU/t.</p>

<p>Thus, in the same time we can perform a different number of the same recipe.</p>

<h5 id="wireless-communication">Wireless communication</h5>

<p>In IMPACT Parallelism works by wireless communication.</p>

<p>The communication is represented as follows:</p>

<p>Parallel Computer &gt; Communications Tower &gt; Space Satellite &gt; Communications Tower &gt; Parallel Machines.</p>

<p>A special tool, the notebook, is used for all connections.</p>

<p>Connecting the Space Satellite to the Communications Tower (see below):</p>

<p>Connecting the Communication Tower to the Parallel Computer and to the Parallel Machines (see below):</p>

<h5 id="space-satellite">Space satellite</h5>

<p>This machine must be in Orbit to transmit communication between the Communications Tower.</p>

<p>For more information, see this article - <a href="/wiki/machines#spacesatellite">Space satellite</a></p>

<h5 id="communication-tower">Communication Tower</h5>

<p>This machine allows communication between the Parallel Machines and the Parallel Computer.</p>

<p>For more information, see this article - <a href="/wiki/machines#communicationtower">Communication Tower</a></p>

<h5 id="parallel-computer">Parallel Computer</h5>

<p>This machine is capable of generating PP. In order to generate PP, special CPU cores are required.</p>

<p>There are 4 tiers of CPU cores, which are divided by PP generation: 4, 16, 64, 256.</p>

<p>PP transmission requires special hatches- Parallel Transmitter.</p>

<p>There are 4 tiers of Parallel Transmitter which limit maximum PP transmission: 4, 16, 64, 256.</p>

<p>For more information, see this article - <a href="/wiki/machines#parallelsupercomputer">Parallel Computer</a></p>

<h5 id="parallel-machines">Parallel Machines</h5>

<p>There are many machines in IMPACT that can process recipes in parallel (have parallelism).
It is written in the description of these machines.</p>

<p>Such machines are capable of spending parallelism points. To make a machine parallel, you need to put a special hatch in it - Parallel Receiver, without it the machine is not parallel and performs recipes in the usual way.</p>

<p>There are 4 tiers of Parallel Receiver, which limit the maximum number of PP: 4, 16, 64, 256.</p>

<p>Hatches canâ€™t just issue PP to a machine, it requires a connection to a Parallel Computer.</p>

<p>To connect to a computer you will need a Laptop (see below).</p>
